He is the author of the novel The Greatest Show on Earth. A very young child recalls waiting in a bread line for food as one of his earliest memories as a young child.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jerry-buss.jpg alt="jerry buss" width=1250 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jerry’s dedication earned him a scholarship to the University of Wyoming, where he completed his degree in just 2.5 years. Jerry had already earned an MS and a Ph.D in chemistry from the University of Southern California by the time he turned 24.</p><h2><strong>Jerry Buss Career</strong></h2><p><strong>House And Properties:</strong></p><p>Following graduation, he worked as a chemist and for a short time in the <a href=#>aerospace</a> industry before returning to the University of <a href=#>Southern California</a> as a faculty member in the chemistry department. While working as a teacher at <a href=# rel=noopener>USC,</a> Jerry began investing in real estate in the Los Angeles area in order to supplement his teacher’s salary with additional income.</p><p>Jerry’s side business soon became so profitable that he was able to abandon his teaching career entirely and devote his time and energy solely to real estate. Jerry Buss would eventually become a very wealthy individual.</p><p><strong>Ownership of Sports Team:</strong></p><p>By 1979, Jerry had amassed enough funds to purchase the Los Angeles Lakers, the Sacramento Kings, and the Forum sports complex for a total of $67.5 million. Putting it into real money terms, that’s the equivalent of $213 million. During that time period, it was the most expensive sports franchise acquisition in history, and under Jerry’s guidance, the Lakers won their first of ten NBA championships in less than a year. The Los Angeles Lakers are one of the most successful and well-known sports franchises in history, with a market capitalization of more than $1 billion dollars.</p><p>Buss purchased the Sparks in 2002 when the WNBA changed its structure to allow each squad to have its own owner. In 2006, he sold the team to a third party. In addition, Buss acquired the Los Angeles Lazers of the Major Indoor Soccer League. The Lazers also played a show at The Forum in New York. In 1989, the team went out of business, and three years later, the league went out of business as well.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to the sport, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. The American Academy of Achievement presented Buss with the Golden Plate Award in 1983 for his contributions to society.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jerry-buss-death.jpg alt="jerry buss death" width=1250 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Poker Player:</strong></p><p>For several decades, Buss competed in high-stakes cash tournaments, but as he got older, he began to focus more on tournaments and less on cash games. One of his best performances came in a seven-card stud tournament at the 1991 World Series of Poker, and the other came in a World Poker Tour Freeroll tournament in 2003, both in which he finished second. He has also appeared on the GSN poker show High Stakes Poker as well as the NBC late-night show Poker After Dark, among other projects.</p><p><strong>Other Works:</strong></p><p>Buss was the producer of the 1974 film Black Eye, which starred Fred “the Hammer” Williamson, a retired gridiron star who had a starring role in the film.</p><p>Buss was the owner and operator of the Playboy Club in Phoenix.</p><h2><strong>Jerry Buss About The Net Worth, Height, Weight, And Age</strong></h2><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td><strong>$600 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td><strong>Jerry Buss</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td><strong>80</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td><strong>(1.73 m)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td><strong>80KG (Approx)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td><strong>Businessman</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td><strong>January 27, 1933</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Birthplace</td><td><strong>United States</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td><strong>American</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Income</td><td><strong>$50 Million (Annual)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td><strong>JoAnn Mueller</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>Jerry Buss Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Additionally, Buss was a skilled poker player who competed on a professional level.

He is survived by six children, all of whom are active members of the Los Angeles Lakers organization.</p><h2><strong>Jerry Buss </strong><strong>Death</strong></h2><p>Buss was confined to a hospital bed for several months in 2012 due to an unidentified digestive ailment<strong>. He decided not to attend a Lakers game from the start of the 2012–13 season until he turned 80 years old in 2013.</strong> He cited medical reasons for his decision. Buss had been battling cancer since 2012, according to information released four days before his death in that same year.</p><p>Having been admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with an unidentified form of cancer in February 2013, he died of renal failure the following month at the age of 80.</p><h2>Jerry Buss’s NBA Finals run is the Warriors’ franchise goal, according to Lacob.</h2><p>The Warriors won their fourth championship in the previous eight years last month. Joe Lacob, the team’s main owner, is pleased with the team’s accomplishment, but he recently stated that he wants them to keep winning championships at a historically high pace.</p><p>Lacob, who took over as the team’s primary owner in 2010, spoke about his ultimate franchise aim on Warriors player Andre Iguodala’s podcast Point Forward, which is co-hosted by Evan Turner.</p><p>The reality is that I will focus solely on winning games and championships for the rest of my life, according to Lacob. “I’m a lunatic. I just care about that. There you go.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I'm about only one thing…winning and winning Championships." <a href=# rel=noopener>@andre</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>@thekidet</a> host a special guest this week: <a href=# rel=noopener>@warriors</a> governor Joe Lacob.</p><p>Be sure to tap in tomorrow wherever you listen to pods and on YT. <a href=# rel=noopener>#pointforwardfriday</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#LinkInBio</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/e8GU2n5P1P</a></p><p>— Point Forward (@pointforward) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 14, 2022</a></p><p>In addition to their title victories, the Warriors have advanced to six of the last 12 NBA Finals, according to Lacob. He compared it to Jerry Buss’s ownership of the Lakers. In the 33 years that Buss owned the team or roughly half of his ownership history, Los Angeles made it to 16 NBA Finals. Lacob acknowledged that due to this run, he admires Buss.</p><p>Therefore, Lacob stated, “I don’t know whether we can continue that 50% rate, but I’m certainly as heck going to try.” “Having this team be fantastic is my goal,” the coach said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5%2Bys77YZpmuq6Niu6bAjLCmq6yYYn9xfpFmmGaqlZa5bsDIppxmraCZrrWxjKilZqKVp7%2B6ecGuqqxlnJ6zpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
