Just like a lot of people, Sanaa Lathan thought it was funny that Beyoncé being bitten by someone became such a big story, but she didn’t like it when she was accused of being the culprit. 
In an interview with Health, the actress denied committing the strange act and said it’s something she’d never do. 
“I think it’s the most absurd thing I’ve ever been involved with,” she said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They used to devastate me in my 20s, but in order to survive in this business you just have to let it roll.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I adore Beyoncé,” added Lathan. “I would never do anything malicious like that to her or to anyone. It’s so bizarre. I thought it was the funniest thing ever that it was a news story. It’s so crazy.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s been over two months since Tiffany Haddish told that story about the R&B star being bitten at an after-party for one of her concerts. Eventually, Haddish caught backlash for it and even Bey seemed to send her a shot in the song “Top Off.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“If they trying to party with the queen / They gon’ have to sign a non-disclosure,” she sang.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Haddish, while at the party, she saw Beyoncé approach JAY-Z in anger and was later told about the biting incident. She even offered to fight the individual, but Bey stopped her and the two took a photo together that went viral.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Haddish didn’t reveal any names when she relayed the story, but since Lathan posted a clip of herself attending that same Beyoncé show, some called her the biter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Y’all are funny,” tweeted Lathan around that time. “Under no circumstances did I bite Beyonce and if I did, it would’ve been a love bite.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s not clear if the biting rumors had anything to do with it, but Lathan said it’s imperative for her to leave social media at times, because it sends her on mental tangents.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“You know what is a real happiness killer? Social media,” she said. “I don’t think it’s healthy for humans to constantly compare themselves..</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“By nature, even if you see someone who you adore and they’re in Fiji, automatically you go, ‘Well, damn, I’m here.’ I think the key to happiness is keeping your eyes on your path. Rarely are you going on [social media] and [thinking], ‘Ooh, I’m happy.’ It’s always a shift toward a darker emotion. So I have to take social media breaks.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX55e49uZmpoX6iur63AZqOarJiWu26uyK2gp59dl7K6u82cnGaZkqjCs7CMrZ%2BippditrexjJ6tnqpdnru3u8uvnJ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
