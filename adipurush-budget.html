Om Raut is the director, and T-Series Films and Retrophiles are the producers. The movie, starring Prabhas as Raghava, Kriti Sanon as Janaki, and Saif Ali Khan as Lankesh, was simultaneously shot in Hindi and Telugu. Adipurush is one of the most expensive Indian movies ever made, with a budget of 500 crores (US$63 million).</p><h2>Adipurush Release Date</h2><p>Adipurush is slated for theatrical release in Hindi and Telugu on January 12, 2023, as well as dubbed versions in Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada. Originally slated to hit theatres on August 11, 2022, Laal Singh Chaddha’s release forced a postponement. The teaser for the film was unveiled on October 2, 2022, in honor of Gandhi Jayanti.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Prabhas (@actorprabhas)</a></p><h2>Adipurush Cast Salary</h2><p>The main actor of the movie, Prabhas, who plays Lord Rama or Raghava, has set a lofty fee of Rs 150 crores. Prabhas is one of the highest-paid Indian actors ever thanks to his payment for the movie Adipurush. Saif Ali Khan received Rs 12 crores for his performance as Lankesh, a character based on Ravana.</p><p>Kriti Sanon, who portrays Prabhas’s love interest and is the film’s primary female actress, is paid Rs 3 crores for the part. According to reports, Sunny Singh received Rs 1.5 crores for playing Lakshmana in the movie. Sonal Chauhan received a payment of about Rs 50 lakh.</p><p>The cast salary for Adipurush is absolutely absurd, which will surprise Indian viewers. To date, no Indian film has been produced on this scale. Audience reactions to the movie’s trailer have been mixed, so we are eagerly awaiting the movie’s release to find out how well it will perform financially.</p><p>Adipurush retells the Ramayana tale in an unusual setting. Great visual effects in the film have undoubtedly energized Indian viewers. At the box office in January 2023, this movie might give Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan a run for its money.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani)</a></p><h2>Total Budget of Movie Adipurush</h2><p>Adipurush has a $500 billion budget, Kumar reportedly stated in a Pinkvilla report. We are aware that the opening for that movie will be enormous, spanning the width of a house. Therefore, we will proceed with blockbuster pricing in an effort to maximize the demand for the movie. Since it is a unique event cinema with a small seating capacity, we are confident that audiences will show up regardless of the cost. Therefore, we would ensure that we gave this movie our all.</p><h2>Makers of Adipurush</h2><p>Adipurush is Prabhas’ third collaboration with producer Bhushan Kumar after Radhe Shyam and Saaho, and it is financed by him along with Krishan Kumar, Om Raut, Prasad Sutar, and Rajesh Nair.</p><p>The movie is produced by Bhusan Kumar’s T-Series Films in collaboration with director Raut’s own home banner Retrophiles.</p><h2>Adipurush Teaser</h2><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvAnaCpraKqwKl5wa6boJ2kZIB0fZFwZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
