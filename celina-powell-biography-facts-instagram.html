Some sources however claimed that her mom was a prostitute and a drug addict who was in and out of jail. Celina and her siblings (two sisters and a brother) were basically raised by their aunt and grandmother.</p><p>Celina’s childhood was unfortunately not all rosy; she was raped at the age of 12 by some men in her neighborhood after getting drunk with her brother’s girlfriend. This caused the family to move to Wheat Ridge and Celina had to transfer from her Christian school to Wheat Ridge High School which is a public secondary school in Jefferson County, Colorado, USA.</p><p>Apparently, Celina did not attend or has not attended college as there are no records yet of her graduating from or being in college. Celina who is currently 28 has instead decided to make a name for herself via the new gold mine of the day; social media. Her looks, demeanor, and crazy wild stories of escapades with the rich and famous were just the right content she needed to shoot herself to overnight fame.</p><h2><strong>She Turned Her Life Around for Good Using Social Media (Instagram)</strong></h2><p>Celina took to social media with Instagram being her platform of choice. On the photo and video-sharing social networking platform, she began to accumulate a huge number of followers by posting sexually provocative pictures which in line with expectations appealed to a lot of people. As her fame grew, Celina Powell began doing what can be described as cyberbullying depending on the stance you take on it.</p><p>Celina Powell is notorious for harassing celebrities. First, she chats them up, and when they fall into her trap and begin chatting with her, she initiates FaceTime conversations and says things that ordinarily shouldn’t be heard by a third ear. She will then turn around and try to expose them by posting screenshots of such conversations on Twitter.</p><p>“The Black Widow” also does something else that might have earned her more foes than friends? Mildly put, she is an influencer, but then if you want to be more specific, she is a “clout chaser”. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Slangit</a> (an online slang dictionary); clout chasing is when someone does and says things for the sole purpose of becoming more popular. It is most often used to describe people on social sites that are shallow and desperate to gain followers and become famous.</p><h3><strong>Celina Powell Branded Herself “The Black Widow” Following Her Many Sexual Escapades</strong></h3><p>Celina Powell began going by the name ‘The Black Widow’ after her alleged involvement with several A-list artists began to go viral. Whether facts or fabricated, her stories of wild sexual escapades and multiple pregnancy allegations surprisingly grabbed enough attention to make her quite known amongst America’s entertainment circle.</p><p>Although mostly in the news for negative and controversial happenings, Celina soon gained enough following and subsequently gained modeling deals for some top bikini clothing brands and cosmetic companies. She has also featured in podcasts (No Jumper), where she and now ex-best friend Aliza entertained listeners with their wild encounters.</p><h2><strong>Top Celebrities That Have Fallen Into Celina’s Trap in Her Quest for Fame</strong></h2><p>With her inordinate desire to get famous leeching off male celebrities when they are most vulnerable, Celina Powell has gone for some big heads and can be said to have been remarkably successful with her strategy. Here are some of the A-list celebrities she had gone after in the past and an insight into what transpired between them.</p><h3><strong>Celina Faked Being Pregnant for Offset and Later Apologized</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/pjimage-161.jpg><p>Celina was embroiled in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>nasty drama</a> with Offset around late 2017 and early 2018 when she claimed she was pregnant for the rapper. At that time, Offset was expecting his first child with his wife <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Cardi B</a>. Celina even posted a positive pregnancy test and ultrasound result to further prove her case and of course, she got the attention she was looking for. This was a bit too much for the rapper who had his lawyer send a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>cease and desist letter to Celina</a>.</p><p>He further disclosed that Celina promised to abort the baby (which she had already named Karma Lee Cephus) if he paid her $50,000. Responding on Twitter, the controversial Celina said she won’t cease and desist “SHIT” in addition to other vulgar things which can’t be accommodated here. Powell also hinted that she has already got herself a lawyer to compel Offset to go for a DNA test once baby Karma is born.</p><p>Celina Powell later made a video revealing that the whole <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>pregnancy thing was a sham</a>, and the tests and ultrasounds she posted online were that of a friend. She made an ‘apology’ to Offset and Cardi B about the whole issue but as to be expected Cardi B wasn’t exactly thrilled with the influencer and gave her a piece of her mind. Really, Celina went too far with this one, and guess what, there is more!</p><h3><strong>She Exposed Snoop Dogg After She Felt Slighted With How He Treated Her</strong></h3><p>Another celebrity that she topped into a sex scandal was <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Snoop Dogg</a>. She alleged that Snoop FaceTimed her several times prior to their meeting up. For their first meet-up, she claimed Snoop flew out to meet her and she ended up having sex with him on their very first meeting, and in the heat of the excitement, he even snorted cocaine off her body.</p><p>She further claimed that the second time she met him, she went to his place with a friend of hers. They had drinks and after a while, she disappeared into a room with Snoop. When they came out, Celina’s friend had already gone. This, according to her, got Snoop upset. He then left her with one of his bodyguards who told Celina to get an Uber that will take her home. According to Celina Powell, Snoop ignored her subsequent calls and this prompted her to expose him.</p><p>In a turn of events, Snoop, who denied the allegations, came out to say that his involvement with Celina was all due to a show he was working on. The show which is all about clout chasing is yet to be broadcast, so as of now, we aren’t sure what to believe or not. What is sure though is that her alleged involvement with Snoop Dogg has definitely given her more content and the much-sought exposure she is building a social media career out of.</p><h3><strong>Celina Powell was Unsuccessful in Her Attempt To Rope Drake In</strong></h3><p>After the allegations with Snoop Dogg, Celina once again cast her net out for a bigger fish; <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Drake</a>. However, if we know anything about Drake, we know that he can play the game too. In <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">chats evidence</a> released by Celina in January 2021, Drake tactfully distanced himself from her. In response to Celina’s attempt to cozy up to him, Drake wrote: “Def never gave u my number. I know who u are. I want nooooo parts,”</p><p>Celina wrote back, claiming that Drake has been in her dm though and Drake in a response posted a screenshot of the alleged direct messages in an attempt to prove her wrong. Celina finally backed down and that effectively ended all she was planning to attack him with.</p><h3><strong>She Has a Never-Ending List of Controversies With Celebrities</strong></h3><p>It is with stories and accusations like this and even those worse that Celina has thrived and gotten famous. Her list of celebrities whom she has either dated, allegedly slept with, or gotten pregnant for is quite extensive; Akon, Fetty Wap, FatBoy SSE, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Dwight Howard, Swae Lee, Cash Out, Chief Keef, Waka Flocka Flame, DJ Akademiks, MoneyBagg Yo Fabolous, Tee Grizzley, Lil Pump, Eminem, Gucci Mane, Jason Derulo, etc.</p><p>Her relationship with Dj Akademiks has been more of an on-and-off basis. Dj Akademiks even bought her a brand new Mercedes Benz G-Wagon at one point! Tekashi 6ix9ine was also once rumored to be involved with her after a picture surfaced of them in bed together.</p><p>However, it was later revealed that it was staged, for clout probably. Aaron Carter and Bryce Hall have also been roped into Celina’s web of affairs, although none of her claimed relationship with the two has been confirmed. Comedian Michael Blackson has also <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that Celina has been trying to sleep with him.</p><p>Celina Powell has not always had things go her way as on a few occasions, she has been found wanting on the wrong side of the law. On December 30, 2018, bounty hunters caught up with her and got her arrested for having $61,000 worth of outstanding bonds in her name. Her offense ranged from shoplifting to evading police to violating traffic laws.</p><h2><strong>How Many Followers Does Celina Powell Have on Instagram?</strong></h2><p>Celina Powell kicked off her ‘career’ from Instagram, joining the social media platform in 2017. Since then she has grown a massive following of 3.2 million followers for now. This is many thanks to her controversial takes against male celebrities and of course the sexy and provocative pictures.</p><p>As a model and an influencer, the platform that launched her career has continued to support her strong fanbase. Although she has a YouTube channel with 122k subscribers and a Twitter account of 15.9k followers, her exclusive contents are reserved for her OnlyFans page, where she shares her sex tapes and much more.</p><h2><strong>Celina’s Voluptous Body is Her Other Selling Point</strong></h2><p>Apart from her juicy takes on alleged relationships with celebrities, one noticeable thing about “The Black Widow” is her sexy and curvy body. She stands at a height of 5 feet 4 inches, has body measurements of 33 – 24 – 34 inches with well-rounded hips.</p><p>Looking at her, you would definitely know that she has got some <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>work done</a>; she has had butt injections, breast augmentation, liposuction, and rhinoplasty. She apparently also loves tattoos and is covered with different patterns of tattoo art.</p><p>The 5′ 4″ diva, though not au naturel, is still as stunning when she poses for her pictures. Her figure-8 physique, as accentuated by her 33-25-34 inches proportions is definitely eye-catching. No wonder fashion brands have approached her to model their lingerie products. At least they can tap into all the ‘negative’ publicity and make some good dough. A win-win for both parties.</p><h3><strong>What is Celina Powell’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>There are various estimations as to the net worth of Celina Powell. With income from her Youtube videos, modeling gigs, and OnlyFans revenue, she is estimated to be worth $1 million or more.</p><h3><strong>What is Celina Powell’s Age?</strong></h3><p>Celina Powell, who was born on 13th June 1995, is currently 28 years old.</p><h3><strong>Is Celina Powell Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>None, as far as we know.

Peradventure she decides to have a kid, it will make a lot of buzz owing to who the father of the baby might be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCvxKWgp5ldpby4sculZJuhn5y%2ForzHsmSfmZOpwG61zayrmp%2Bilrpw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
