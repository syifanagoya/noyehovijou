Katie is now giving information about her tumultuous relationship, saying that it was her ex-boyfriend John Hersey who “dumped” her.&nbsp;Katie Thurston talked out about the split on the Vine, a Bachelor Nation podcast hosted by Kaitlyn Bristowe, on Tuesday, August 23, and said:</p><p>“He ditched me. In fact, we really split up twice. Nobody knew about it the first time… We worked over it and agreed to get back together a week or two later, so I believed we were set.”</p><h2>Katie Thurston and John Hersey from The Bachelorette</h2><p>Katie is now spilling the beans on why her relationship with John terminated two months ago. Katie remarked on the show that being in a relationship is difficult and went on to explain the key cause for her breakup with John.&nbsp;She said that John needs someone to share his interests with him and “maybe learn to surf” with him. Katie was irritated by his suggestion. She said,</p><p>“I jumped out of a f**king plane three times… to share his interests.” Eight hours of ground school, all of this for him to participate in his love, and it was entirely neglected, and now we’re focused on surfing.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Katie-thurston-2.jpg alt="Katie thurston" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Katie even gave him a van to show how important he was in her life, and she tried to change herself for John, but nothing could save their relationship. She let it all out:</p><p>“I got him a freakin’ vacation van.” I allowed this individual to resign from his employment. ‘Whatever you need me to be, I will be,’ I said. In retrospect, this is neither healthy nor beneficial. But it’s a bit, like, disrespectful to be like, “Damn, I gave you everything, and this isn’t working out.”</p><h2>Katie Thurston and John Hersey’s relationship</h2><p>Katie met John as a contestant on The Bachelorette during her season. He was ousted from the reality dating program in the second week, but the two reconciled after The Bachelorette ended. Before starting a love connection, the two were friends.&nbsp;They made their relationship public in November, only a month after Katie called off her engagement to season winner Blake Moynes in October 2021, three months after The Bachelorette finale aired.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Katie-thurston-1.jpg alt="Katie thurston" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite “a lot of public criticism regarding that circumstance,” Katie pushed forward with John. They divorced after just a few months of dating.&nbsp;The Washington native confessed she was “in denial at first” after the separation. She went on,</p><p>“It just took me off guard, and I just placed all my eggs in one basket with this guy, and I don’t want to say I regret it because I believe every relationship is a lesson, but it was just a six-month crash, and burn.”</p><p>Despite the separation, the 31-year-old The Bachelorette star claims to be in a good place today.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiimqyZmnq1tNSrqq2nnmKur7rOrqWcnZRitaa%2BjJupnpmbYsKxedaiq6FlmqS1r3nHnqmsnalirqfAxKtknZmknruoecWoqWZvXaK8r8DHaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
