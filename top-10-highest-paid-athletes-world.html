His $52.8 million in earnings over the last 12 months includes a healthy $20.8 million in salary and winnings as well as $32 million worth of endorsements for brands like Under Armour, AT&T, Titleist, Perfect Sense, Rolex, NetJets and Super Strokes.</p><p><strong>#8. <a href=# title="Phil Mickelson Net Worth">Phil Mickelson</a> – $52.9 million</strong></p><p>Spieth came just short of being the biggest earner in golf, though, a title that is held by Phil Mickelson, even with his relatively paltry on-course earnings of just $2.9 million. He made up the ground and then some, though, thanks to $50 million in endorsement income over the last year.</p><p><strong>#7. <a href=# title="Cam Newton Net Worth">Cam Newton</a> – $53.1 million</strong></p><p>The first and only football player on this list is Cam Newton. He made it in, thanks to his $41.1 million annual salary with another $12 million in endorsements on top of that – making him the top earner in his sport.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-196124 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GettyImages-512373756.jpg alt="Cam Newton" width=900 height=612 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-196124 class=wp-caption-text>Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</p><p><strong>#6. <a href=# title="Novak Djokovic Net Worth">Novak Djokovic</a> – $55.8 million</strong></p><p>Novak Djokovic reached his share of financial milestones this year, including surpassing the legendary <a href=# title="Roger Federer Net Worth">Roger Federer</a> in career prize winnings. But he didn't quite make more than Federer this year, pulling in $55.8 million in total earnings from his on-court performance and endorsements.</p><p><strong>#5. <a href=# title="Kevin Durant Net Worth">Kevin Durant</a> – $56.2 million</strong></p><p>The second basketball player on this list is Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Durant earned $20.2 million from the Thunder over the last year, with the other $36 million coming from his endorsement deals with Sprint, Nike, Gatorade, and more.</p><p><strong>#4. Roger Federer – $67.8 million</strong></p><p>Roger Federer's $60 million in endorsement deals is testament to his enduring name recognition, which also makes him one of the most famous people in tennis today. And the $7.8 million in prize winnings shows that he's still a force on the court as well – altogether, he is the biggest earner in tennis this year, by far.</p><p><strong>#3. <a href=# title="LeBron James Net Worth">LeBron James</a> – $77.2 million</strong></p><p>To say LeBron James has had a good year would be a criminal understatement, but suffice it to say that in addition to his numerous other accomplishments, he's also not doing too badly when it comes to his finances. $23.2 million in well-earned salary plus $54 million in endorsements make him basketball's highest earner this year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-195919 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages-519455520.jpg alt="Lebron James" width=900 height=603 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-195919 class=wp-caption-text>Lebron James / Andy Lyons/Getty Images</p><p><strong>#2. <a href=# title="Lionel Messi Net Worth">Lionel Messi</a> – $81.4 million</strong></p><p>Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, so you'd have to be a stereotypically solipsistic American to be too shocked that the top two earners in sports this year are soccer players. Coming up first, is Lionel Messi, with $53.4 million in salary and $28 million in endorsements.</p><p><strong>#1. <a href=# title="Cristiano Ronaldo Net Worth">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> – $88 million</strong></p><p>Soccer's highest earner, and by extension all of sports' highest earner, is none other than Cristiano Ronaldo over the last year. He achieved this with a $56 million salary (much higher than most of the other salaries on this list), and $32 million in endorsements from brands including Nike, Coke, Armani, KFC (!), and many more.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-195789 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages-455987296.jpg alt="Cristiano Ronaldo" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-195789 class=wp-caption-text>Cristiano Ronaldo / Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnDAzqlkamhdnbaotMSsq2aokZ6xbq3ToaOerJWoeri70aWbaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
