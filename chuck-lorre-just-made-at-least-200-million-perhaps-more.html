Among all this news, you might have missed that the popular sitcom,&nbsp;Big Bang Theory, was secured by WarnerMedia for its upcoming HBO Max streaming service, in what The Hollywood Reporter calls "easily a record-setting five-year deal" worth "billions of dollars." And that's very good news for the show's creator and executive producer <a href=#>Chuck Lorre</a>.</p><p>Other reports have streaming rights for the show's 12 seasons being sold for a billion dollars, but even if they went for "only" a billion (which would still put it in the very top tier of deals of this nature), Lorre would have made an easy $200 million. That's on account of his unprecedented 20 percent stake in the show's royalties, which would in turn make him at least $400 million richer if the deal with HBO Max is indeed worth "billions."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-287864 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-136002917.jpg alt width=900 height=603 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-287864 class=wp-caption-text>Mark Davis/Getty Images</p><p>For context, Netflix paid a reported $500 million for exclusive global streaming rights to Seinfeld, the same amount that NBCUniversal has paid for exclusive streaming rights to The Office, while WarnerMedia shelled out some $425 million for Friends. And most of these deals are for streaming rights over a period of five years.</p><p>Of course, streaming is merely a single way that a popular show like Big Bang Theory generates revenue for its creators. Another big source of money is from cable reruns, unlike&nbsp;Seinfeld,&nbsp;Big Bang Theory&nbsp;will continue to be seen on TBS through the year 2028 (like HBO Max, TBS is owned by WarnerMedia). And it's a safe bet that Chuck Lorre made another boatload of money on that extension as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCvx66apGWcpL%2BzsYyjrKysXaKupbGMmqtmpJWWwLV5kWlnZqWZobmqu81mp56qmJa9tHnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
