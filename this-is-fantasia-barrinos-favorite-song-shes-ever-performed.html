But when you're going through it, nobody wants to hear it. It's like, 'that sounds good, but I don't how to pay my rent, pay my car payment or I'm losing my marriage.'"</p><p>The singer also opened up about what performing the song does to her, telling NBC News, "My husband just told me, 'Whenever you perform that song you get really messed up, why is that?'" She explained that it's because she remembers the "times when [she] was going through such turmoil," which means that she "know[s] how that person in the front row is feeling."</p><p>"I never can see the audience when I'm performing onstage, but whenever I sing 'Lose to Win,' I can always look out and see that person that's going through it," she said. "As a soul singer, my intentions are to minister, heal, and to help."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lkbYN1e9OhoKxlmah6p63NrZisoZFir6K%2B0aKlqKtdm663u9Giq55lo6S7qHnSoZysZZWrsrN5z56pn6eiorKlew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
