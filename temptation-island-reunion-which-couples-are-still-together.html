Despite the fact that he and girlfriend Erica, 24, set “no rules” before going in, she still felt betrayed.</p><p>“I feel like when you’re in a relationship, even if you go into this experience and say, ‘No rules,’ I shouldn’t have to tell my partner, ‘<a href=#>Hey, don’t cheat on me,</a>‘ or ‘Hey, don’t disrespect me,'” Erica said during the reunion. “That’s what I expected from him.”</p><p>The pair became the most controversial of the season since <a href=#>Kendal hooked up with multiple women</a> during his time on the island. During the final bonfire, Erica chose to leave alone — and he was shocked, continuously asking her whether she was sure.</p><p>“I love you so much. I’ve never loved anyone the way that I’ve loved you. But this process has taught me that it’s important that I love myself beyond that and that I put myself first. For that reason, I’ll be leaving by myself,” Erica said, much to his surprise. “The Erica that came into this, that’s not the same Erica right now. I stand firm in that decision, so you don’t have to keep asking me. I’ve gotta love myself more. I’ve gotta put myself first.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With that, he said he’d “try something new” and <a href=#>left with <strong>Alexcys Homan</strong></a>.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see where each couple stood at the reunion:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bpsq6805qroqeeYra0uMCnm2aqlaq7qrvNZq6hoZOdeqS71Kmjnqtdlr%2BmedKtoKWkXam8qLHToZyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
