In particular, German musician and record producer Frank Farian brought together Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus to form the duo.</strong></p><p>Also, the duo’s first album, All or Nothing, came out in November 1988 in Europe. In the United States, it was repackaged and called Girl You Know It’s True in 1989. Also, on February 21, 1990, Fab and Rob won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.</p><p>The duo also sold millions of records and became the most popular pop group in the early 1990s. Milli Vanilli made three studio albums, including All or Nothing (1988), Girl You Know It’s True (1989), and The Moment of Truth (1990).

Rapper Caught Red-Handed During His Show</h2><p>Milli Vanilli was at the top of their game in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but the audience caught on to their fake lip sync and didn’t react as they should have. Many people said that they weren’t the singer from the album.</p><p>Fans first noticed that they were lip-syncing during a live show on MTV on July 21, 1989, at the Lake Compounce theme park in Bristol, Connecticut. The scandals were big news in the music business, and Farian kicked them out of the group and admitted that they didn’t sing on the records.</p><p>Milli Vanilli’s 1990 Grammy for Best New Artist was also taken away by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Pilatus and Morvan admitted everything at a press conference with over 100 Journalists and said they would return their Grammy Award.</p><h2>What’s going on with Milli Vanilli?</h2><p>Milli Vanilli doesn’t work any more because they stopped making music in 1998. But they tried to get their careers back on track and made a new Milli Vanilli album in 1997 with Morvan and Pilatus singing lead vocals.</p><p>Also, the duo made a comeback album called Back and In Attack in 1998, but Pilatus had a lot of trouble with drugs and crime in the days that followed. Pilatus got three months in a California jail that was also a drug rehab center.</p><p>On the other hand, Pilatus died in a hotel room in Frankfurt, Germany, on April 2, 1998, from an overdose of alcohol and prescription drugs.
