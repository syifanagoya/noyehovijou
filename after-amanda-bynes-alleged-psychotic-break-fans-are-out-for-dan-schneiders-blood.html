After dialing 911 herself, Bynes then waited for police who eventually put her under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>Reports, although conflicting, seem to have spread across the internet like wildfire â€” and as fans around the globe come to support Amanda during whatâ€™s sure to be a traumatic chapter, they also believe they know where to place blame.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Actor, producer, and screenwriter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Schneider</a> worked with some of the most iconic teenage talent Hollywood had to offer in the late â€™90s and early 2000s. People like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miranda Cosgrove</a>, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Peck</a>, and Jamie Lynn Spears. He helped turn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nickelodeon</a> into multi-billion dollar network, and for a time, he could do no wrong.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Fired from the company in 2018 for allegations surrounding his conduct around the aforementioned child stars, Schneider was said to have harbored biases against his female coworkers, and to have supplied alcohol to the underage actors. Although never formally charged, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Schneider was investigated by Viacom</a> (a Paramount company).</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>In the wake of Amanda Bynesâ€™ psychiatric emergency, Schneider has come under renewed scrutiny, and although nothing has been confirmed outright, it seems to be (to say the very least) justified. If you need some substantiation of his culpability, take a look at some of these Twitter reacts bellow. Calling them fiery would certainly be an understatement.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>More importantly, Dan Schneider broke her. <a href=#>https://t.co/ccw3vPxgkJ</a></p>â€” Kevin Damoah (@damoah_kevin) <a href=#>March 21, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Someone should be looking into dan Schneider and the DAMAGE hes not done to not just Amanda Byrnes but other childhood stars.</p>â€” XJESSEX (@xjessex626) <a href=#>March 21, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>How has Dan Schneider not got got yet</p>â€” tweety. ðŸ¤Ž (@MsOgechi) <a href=#>March 21, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>In essence, people are blaming many of the longstanding issues Schneiderâ€™s child stars have gone on to deal with on the shady producer himself, and we donâ€™t blame them. When it comes to unequal power in the entertainment industry, children are the most impacted by the overwhelming influence of predatory or abusive adults. What certainly doesnâ€™t help is having a Machiavellian movie producer around, who couldnâ€™t care less about their best interests.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>For right now, getting to the bottom of Dan Schneiderâ€™s alleged workplace behavior should be the least of our worries when Amanda Bynesâ€™ mental health hangs in the balance. She is clearly a tremendously vulnerable human being, and with that in mind, all anyone can do is wish Miss Bynes well â€” and hope she gets the help she needs and deserves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sup8DEq2SapZGjsaJ5wbKlnqtdlrmtscaem2aoo66wqbvToppmmqKarqx5xZqlrGWRp7Juu9StZJ%2BnomKxorqMrJqhppWesaa%2B0maZpaefmXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
