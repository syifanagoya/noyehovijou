Set in the early 1970s, it follows Cleo, an indigenous live-in maid in a rich but troubled household in Roma. The character was loosely based on Alfonso's own nanny, Libo Rodriguez, who he has said was a huge part of his childhood. Speaking to Variety, he explained: "There is a charge of affection that taints everything. You have a very utilitarian relationship with your loved ones. You're afraid to stop and see their weaknesses. But it started to be clear she had another life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14f844c9ab90-roma-5-z.jpg><p id=edbdhQHqUbQi data-wc=68>Speaking through a translator, Libo said: "[Alfonso] was getting all this information without me knowing what it was for. 'How do you remember this, Libo?' he said. 'Help me remember and understand.' Then it started to become weird. 'Libo, what did you used to wear? How did you dress?' Things like that. I never imagined everything I'm living right now, that a film would be based on me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f9792598d29-roma-2-z.jpg><h2>Who is behind Roma?</h2><p id=en1u6WMV4mda data-wc=97>Alfonso Cuarón is a director, screenwriter and producer, and has directed films including and the 2013 Oscar-nominated for which Alfonso won for Best Director.

The 25-year-old actress has been nominated for an Academy Award for the role, and Alfonso opened up about casting her, telling : "I couldn't the right person. Sometimes, I'd meet women who looked like Libo, but they wouldn't feel like her. Or sometimes I'd meet people who felt like Libo, but they didn't look like her. I was so lucky when I met. It was such an immediate impression. With Yalitza, there was this amazing sense of familiarity; this mix of intelligence and warmth. Then I was anxious because Yalitza said she was not interested, so there were another couple of weeks of sweating until she said yes."
