She previously married Josh Hughes, her high school sweetheart, but the couple split in 2015. She then dated her co-star, Austen Kroll, for two years, but their relationship was turbulent and destructive, ending in 2020.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Madison also had a brief romance with another co-star, Craig Conover, which added to the show’s tension. Madison made headlines in 2021 when she was accused of having an affair with Alex Rodriguez, who was then engaged to Jennifer Lopez.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Madison denied sleeping with Rodriguez, but she did agree to exchange phone conversations and texts.

She was extremely close to her father, and she frequently posted pictures of him on social media.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Southern Charm cast has had a difficult year. Madison’s defeat is the latest in a string of setbacks for the Charmer squad. Olivia Flowers’ brother, Conner Flowers, died while Season 9 was in production. It was highly debated throughout the season, and it had a significant impact on Olivia.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Taylor Ann Green lost her brother, Worth Green, shortly after Season 9 ended. Despite their differences, Olivia stood by Taylor, understanding what it was like to lose a sibling.
