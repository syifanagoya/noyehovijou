While there were previously homes and churches on the bridge, it was the trend of putting severed heads on the bridge that is best remembered.</p><p>Whether it was the head of Scottish rebel William Wallace or King Henry VIII's right-hand man Lord High Chancellor Thomas More, a number of heads of high-profile figures were displayed on spikes as a warning to other would-be traitors.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>The fabulous pop star King Charles was 'obsessed' with and had a picture of on his bedroom wall</a></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26249438.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_1.jpg><p>Many of the structures have used the name London Bridge, yet the most modern bridge was opened on March 17, 1973 by the late Queen.</p><p>London Bridge was also the site where the severed heads of mainly high-profile criminals and traitors were displayed on spikes after their beheading.

He wrote: "The whole is covered on each side with houses so disposed as to have the appearance of a continued street, not at all of a bridge.</p><p>"Upon this is built a tower, on whose top the heads of such as have been executed for high treason are placed on iron spikes: we counted above thirty."</p><p>The last head was impaled in 1661 during the reign of <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>King Charles </a>II, but the display site was later moved to Temple Bar until the practice of exhibiting severed heads was discontinued.</p><p><b>Want more f</b><b>rom MyLondon?
