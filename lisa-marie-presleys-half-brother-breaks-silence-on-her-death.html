Love you sis. Beijos. 💔,” he wrote alongside an old photo of his sister playing with him as a baby.</p><p>Lisa Marie<a href=#> died</a> on Thursday, January 12, after <a href=#>suffering cardiac arrest</a>. She was 54 years old.</p><p>“It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us,” Priscilla confirmed to People on Thursday. “She was the most passionate strong and loving woman I have ever known. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss. Thank you for the love and prayers. At this time there will be no further comment.”</p><p>Though Navarone did not specify his sister’s struggles, Lisa Marie had been candid about her battle with drug addiction over the years. In 2020, her son, Benjamin Keough, died by suicide at age 27. The “You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet” singer spoke openly about her grief about losing her son. Her final Instagram post was a photo of their matching tattoos.</p><p>Lisa Marie was the only child of Priscilla and <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>, who welcomed their daughter in 1968. The Dallas alum and the King of Rock n’ Roll split in 1972 and finalized their divorce one year later. The “Blue Suede Shoes” singer died in 1977. He was 42.</p><p>Lisa Marie, who was married four times — including<a href=#> brief unions to Michael Jackson </a>and <a href=#><strong>Nicolas Cage</strong></a> — would go on to start a family of her own in 1989, two years after her mom gave birth to Navarone.
