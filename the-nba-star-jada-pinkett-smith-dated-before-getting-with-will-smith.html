According to a now-deleted post by ET Online, the fellow actors briefly dated in the 90s.

During a <a href=#>Vlad TV interview</a>, the former model shared that he once approached&nbsp;Pinkett Smith to ask her out, but that she wasn't feeling him. "I came to her and tried to holler at her, but I did it too street, and she kinda put me in check," Beckford shared, adding, "It was a lesson learned. She was just so graceful and beautiful. She didn't shoot me down but she aligned me in the ways of being a gentleman and how I approach women now because of that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm9jbX90e9OhnGamkpZ6tMDAq2SjmZSWerG1zaScraxdqLqqwMdmm5qslZl6o7HFqKmeZZeawbW1zaBksKGknXq4tculZKylmam1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
