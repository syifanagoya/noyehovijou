An investigation into the shooting that occurred in the parking lot of a Rally’s fast food restaurant in northern Kentucky has been opened by the police after shots were fired in the area. It occurred at roughly one in the afternoon at Rally’s, which is situated on Highway 42 in Florence.</p><p>The time of the event was not specified. A witness has indicated that he saw a man get out of a car in which he had been sat and begin firing at another vehicle. The witness stated that he witnessed this happen in front of his eyes. No fewer than nine rounds were fired using the round casings that were identified by the red cups. According to the officials, there is just one person who is being held in custody at this time. Many people believe that he was the one who opened fire on everyone.</p><p>The entire occurrence was witnessed by a single individual who was seeing it all while waiting for a traffic signal to change while he was in the vicinity. The eyewitness who identified himself only as Matt stated that the incident began with at least two persons who were sitting in a car that was parked next to Rally’s. Matt provided the following account of the sequence of events that transpired: “So he jumped out of the car he was sitting in, turned around, the car pulled away, and he started shooting at it.”</p><p>The car took off at a high rate of speed in the direction of Interstate 75. The suspect vehicle was found a short time later by the police in Cincinnati. It was riddled with bullet holes and had no one inside when they found it. Law enforcement authorities spent the afternoon of Wednesday searching the surrounding region for the weapon that was used in the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwv8eopq2hnpx6qrqMn6OoqpWjsKZ5yrJkraeUlsZyecCrqZ6rpJqxbq3FrZyrZZahvLOxzZycZqqRobm6ec%2BaqaShnpx6rbvTZqqhp5%2Bptq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
