The 23-year-old from Cornwall then went on to explain his reasons, which he cited as personal. Speaking in the villa's Beach Hut, Ollie explained at the time: "I have to be honest with myself, and everyone, that I do still love someone else." He continued: "I have to follow my heart in this scenario and it would be wrong for me to ignore these feelings.
