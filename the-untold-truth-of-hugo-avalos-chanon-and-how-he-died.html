Another worker on duty reportedly turned on the emergency switch to stop the machinery, but it was too late.</p><p>By the time Paramedics arrived at the facility just before midnight, Hugo Avalos-Chanon’s body was found entangled in the meat blender used to regulate beef’s fat content. The next day, firefighters arrived at the plant to dismantle the machinery and remove his body. His remains were laid to rest on Saturday, May 11, 2013, and the burial was taken care of by the Omega Funeral & Cremation Service 223 SE 122nd Avenue, Portland, Oregon.</p><h2><strong>Was Hugo Avalos-Chanon’s Death Suspicious?</strong></h2><p>Since the company before then recorded an accident in the plant and been on the state’s radar for safety violations and the circumstances under which he died, some people saw his death as suspicious.&nbsp;The medical report and police investigations, however, revealed that there was nothing suspicious about his death.</p><p>A medical examination carried out on Hugo’s remains revealed that he died of chopping wounds and blunt-force injuries.&nbsp;After interviewing witnesses, reviewing records at the factory, and examining evidence, Inspectors with the state Occupational Safety and Health Division revealed that the machine in the meat-grounding room which Hugo was cleaning on the death of the accident wasn’t properly locked, and this contributed to the accident.</p><p>The team also ruled that an ‘unexpected start-up of the machine’ could cause injuries; thus, &nbsp;the case was ruled a tragic industrial accident, and no foul play was involved.</p><h2><strong>Hugo Died At the Age of 41</strong></h2><p>Hugo Avalos Chanon was 41 years at the time of his death. The late meat blender cleaning contractor was born on February 20, 1972, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. As a result, his zodiac sign is Pisces.</p><h2><strong>Was&nbsp;</strong><strong>Hugo Avalos-Chanon&nbsp;</strong><strong>Married, Who were His Family Members?</strong></h2><p>There are no details about his parents, siblings, or family. A source, however, stated that he was married (wife’s identity unknown) and had children, but their identity had never been revealed. He went further to say that after his death, his wife and family sued his employer for wrongful death.</p><p>According to the source, they also filed against the Interstate Meat Distributors and DCS Sanitation Management for their negligence which resulted in Avalos-Chanon’s tragic death.</p><p>Both employers were reportedly sued for over $5 million, while&nbsp; DCS was fined $6 300 following Avalos-Chanon’s death. The source also revealed that a Clackamas County judge let the family seek punitive damages at trial. However, these claims from the source have not been confirmed.</p><p>Hugo’s case comes out as one of the many workplace injuries recorded in the United States annually. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2.8 out of every 100 workers in the United States are injured in workplace accidents yearly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMGpsYyupa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mp5ZitbazzmaYr5mcpMBur8eapaimXZa7pXnHqK5moJVisaqxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
