The LWO is selling a ton of merchandise, and they are also getting a lot of attention on SmackDown. Rey Mysterio, Zelina Vega, Santo Ecobar, Joaquin Wilde, and Cruz Del Toro have created something very special on WWE television."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Rey Mysterio, Zelina Vega, Santo Ecobar, Joaquin Wilde, and Cruz Del Toro have created something very special on WWE television.</p><p>While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>Alistair McGeorge of Metro</a>, Santos Escobar reflected on how the tribute to the former WWE Champion came together. He gave Rey Mysterio credit for coming up with the idea.</p><p>“That was Rey’s idea. Rey’s a genius. Every single good thing that you could say about this industry, he is that. Sure enough with that. We need something that elevates the LWO and pays respect and homage to who we need to do it.”</p><p>“I believe that’s – as opposed to having us imitate him every step of the way, which I feel would not be the right move, we have that [instead].”</p><p>“It’s sort of like him saying, “It’s my people! I’ll leave you to decide if they’re good enough.” That’s it! Viva la Raza.”</p><p>Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero were very close, and that legacy lives on through so many aspects of WWE programming. Guerrero will never be forgotten, and Mr. 6-1-9 came up with a brilliant way to pay tribute to Latino Heat before every LWO entrance.</p><p>We will have to see what’s next for the LWO. They have a ton of potential, and it’s anyone’s guess how much they have left in the stable. After all, Rey Mysterio and Santos Escobar are set to battle in the finals of the United States Title tournament on SmackDown this week.</p><p>What’s your take on the LWO’s resurgence in WWE?
